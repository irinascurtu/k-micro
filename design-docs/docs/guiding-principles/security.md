- OWASP Top 10: Start with the OWASP Top 10, which outlines the most critical web application security risks. For a .NET developer, being familiar with these risks is crucial because they represent the most common vulnerabilities that could be exploited in your applications. Understanding these risks helps in proactively designing and coding applications to be secure against known vulnerabilities.

- Secure coding practices: Security testing isn’t just about finding bugs; it’s about writing code that’s secure by design. This involves adhering to secure coding practices that help prevent vulnerabilities in the first place. For .NET developers, this means understanding how to safely handle user input, implement proper authentication and authorization, manage sessions securely, and encrypt sensitive data.
- .NET security features: .NET provides a robust set of security features and libraries designed to help developers create secure applications. This includes mechanisms for authentication, authorization, secure communication (SSL/TLS), data protection APIs, and cryptographic services. A thorough understanding of these built-in features allows developers to leverage the framework’s capabilities to enhance security. Many of the foundational elements were covered in Chapter 8, Protecting Data and Apps Using Cryptography.

- Automated security testing tools: Familiarize yourself with automated security testing tools that support .NET applications. Tools like OWASP ZAP offer automated scanning capabilities that can identify vulnerabilities in your code. Additionally, static code analysis tools that integrate with the .NET ecosystem can help analyze your source code for potential security issues before they become a problem. These tools are also known as SAST (Static Application Security Testing) and DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) and they can be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, enabling continuous scanning and providing immediate feedback to developers.

- Threat modeling: Threat modeling is a proactive approach to identify potential security threats to your application and determine the risks they pose. For .NET developers, engaging in threat modeling helps in understanding how an attacker might compromise your application and what controls or design changes can mitigate those risks. Microsoft offers guidance and tools for threat modeling that can be particularly useful in the .NET context.

- Compliance requirements: Depending on the domain your application operates in, there may be specific security compliance requirements you need to adhere to, such as GDPR for data protection, HIPAA for healthcare information, or PCI DSS for payment processing. Understanding these requirements and how they impact application development is crucial for .NET developers to ensure compliance and protect sensitive data.

## OWASP Top 10

 - https://www.owasptopten.org/
- The OWASP Top 10 is a crucial document for web application security, highlighting the most common and severe security risks. As of June 2024, the latest version is from 2021, with a new update expected later in 2024. It reflects the evolving security landscape by addressing both emerging risks and traditional vulnerabilities, focusing on themes like input validation, authentication, access control, and data protection. Regular updates, such as in 2017 and 2021, ensure it remains relevant to current security challenges.
  
 
- **Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)** to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks by forcing browsers to use secure connections, as shown in the following code
```c#
app.UseHsts();
app.UseHttpsRedirection();
```
- A3:2021 – Injection:Never construct SQL queries with string concatenation.Validate and sanitize all user input. Ensure that all input, whether from users, files, databases, or external services, is validated against a strict specification. This means checking data for type, length, format, and range. Use .NET’s built-in methods for HTML encoding and URL encoding to sanitize inputs that will be displayed on pages or included in URLs to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
- A10:2021 – Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
