# Documenting the Code

Introducing documentation
Documenting your source code
Documenting public APIs in class libraries
-Documenting services

### Benefits of documentation
- Improved code understandability
- Enhanced maintainability: 
- Facilitates team member onboarding
- Eases knowledge transfer
- Promotes best practices
- Improves the solution architecture and public APIs
- Facilitates debugging and support
- Enhanced cross-team understanding

### When should you document your source code?

# Understanding the OpenAPI Specification (OAS)
https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html.
Familiarize yourself with the OpenAPI tooling ecosystem, which includes Swashbuckle (Swagger UI, Swagger Editor, and Swagger Codegen), NSwag, and FastEndpoints:

Swashbuckle: https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore
NSwag: https://github.com/RicoSuter/NSwag
FastEndpoints: https://github.com/FastEndpoints/FastEndpoints

https://swagger.io/solutions/api-design/.

Tools:
- https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator
- https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/

For a .NET developer, mastering OpenAPI for services means not only understanding how to document APIs but also leveraging a suite of tools to design, test, secure, and generate code for APIs. Itâ€™s about adopting a specification-first approach to API development, which can lead to more robust, understandable, and easily consumable web services.
